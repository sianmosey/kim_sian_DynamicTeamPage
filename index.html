                Hello, I'm Sian Kim. I am interested in design and have never worked as a designer, but I have learned art related to design since I was younger. So I could still be interested in design. I can handle Photoshop programs, illustration programs, and xd programs, and I like to visualize and display what I think through pictures. I didn't know much about coding until I went to Fanshawe College, but now I am studying with interest.
